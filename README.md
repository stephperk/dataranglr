# DataRanglr -- Driven by Flask

The purpose of DataRanglr is to become the landing page for my freelance services. It also supports user authentication, individual
home pages for my clients, and will become a showcase for my D3.js visualizations.

The registration process delivers unique tokens via email to users who submit registration forms via email.

Upon successful authentication, users will be redirected to their own home page. This will serve as the destination for my clients to 
view their dashboard with data-driven content.
